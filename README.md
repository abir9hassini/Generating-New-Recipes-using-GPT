# Generating-New-Recipes-using-GPT

This project is about Generating Recipes from Ingredients using GPT2. The project is divided into following tasks:

### - Task 1: An introduction to the problem, including a short demo
### - Task 2: Explortory data analsysis of our data, and some basic preprocessing
### - Task 3: Dataset preparation for our modeling
### - Task 4: Basic usecase of distillation and GPT-2
### - Task 5: Launching training on a Google Colab instance with Google Drive integration
### - Task 6: Exploring how well our model generates realistic recipes 
- We used the [Recipe box](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/#fn:1) dataset which is collated by Ryan Lee, and sourced from Food Network, Epicurious, and Allrecipes.
